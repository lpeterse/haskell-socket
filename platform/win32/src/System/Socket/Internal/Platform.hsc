-- | Wait until the socket becomes readable (Windows specific version).
--
--  This operation does not actually do anything with the socket. It just
--  calls `threadDelay` with a delay exponentially increasing in the second
--  parameter (0 => 1Î¼s, 20 or greater => 1s). When the operation returns,
--  the socket shall be tried to read from - it does not imply that there is
--  actually data to read and it might be necessary to wait again!
--
--  On Windows, socket descriptors don't behave like file
--  descriptors, but require a specific select mechanism. Unfortunately,
--  this is not (yet) implemented in GHC's RTS and it cannot be called from here
--  as it would block.
--
--  In practice, this means that your application may suffer from reduced
--  responsibility (up to 1s in case the socket has not seen events for 20
--  cycles). Usually, this is only the case for the first of several sequential
--  reads from a socket. Subsequent reads will be executed without delay until
--  there is no more data to read, so it is still possible to achieve high
--  throughput. The central achievement of this approach is that all socket
--  operations offered by the library are interruptable and no special
--  considerations (apart the from one above) apply when running socket code on
--  Windows.

-- | Wait until the socket is confirmed to be connected (Windows specific version).
--
--   This operation uses an exponential-backoff algorithm as described in
--   `waitRead`. On each iteration `select` is called with a minmal timeout
--   to poll the connection status. This approach keeps the operation interruptable.
